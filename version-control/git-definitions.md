# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control is the concept of controling only one version of a code that way if a mistake is made you can roll back to the previous version or perhaps edit one version while leaving the original unchanged.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is like a copy of an original set of code.  You can make changes to this "copy" and then merge it into the master branch to update the master branch with the new changes.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
a commit is like a save point.  it is how you commit to your changes and make them available to be pushed or pulled to/from GitHub

* What is a merge conflict?
merge conflict is when the code from a branch doesn't match-up with code on the master branch.  this disagreement is discovered when merging.
